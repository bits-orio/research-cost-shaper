# The mod portal rejects any zip containing exe / bat / ps1 / sh / py files.

# outside tools/ later (link-mod.sh already sits at the repo root) cannot
# silently leak into a release.
#
# docs/, site/, spec/, tests/, worker/, dev/ and .run/ are repo-only: the
# portal copy and gallery, the companion web page, the format specs and their
# tests, the share service, the GUI run scripts, and their local artefacts. None of it is of any use inside the shipped mod, and dev/
# and .run/ in particular can hold whole throwaway Factorio saves. The
# ignored local artefacts (build/, .run/, editor workspaces) never exist on
# a CI checkout but do exist locally, so they are excluded explicitly:
# otherwise a hand-built zip would differ from the published one.
# -m prunes empty directories. Git cannot track an empty directory, so one
# that exists in a working tree is absent from a CI checkout. Without this,
# a hand-built zip and the published one differ by exactly those entries.
